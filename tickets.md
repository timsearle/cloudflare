## In Progress
- [ ] Migrate `/.well-known` (AASA + atproto) to Cloudflare static responses (no origin dependency)

## TODO
- [ ] Add Workers route(s) for `/.well-known/atproto-did`
- [ ] Update E2E checks to verify both endpoints and correct Content-Type
- [ ] Remove `.well-known` from blog repo after Cloudflare is live

## Done
